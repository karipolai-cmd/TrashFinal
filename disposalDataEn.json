  "Rubber": {
    "label": "Rubber",
    "instruction": "Take rubber items, such as tires, hoses, or mats, to specialized recycling facilities or auto shops that accept them. If recycling is not available, consider repurposing rubber into useful objects like garden planters, floor mats, or furniture. Avoid burning rubber, as it releases toxic chemicals, and never dispose of it in nature.",
    "fact": "Natural rubber is made from the sap of rubber trees and is extremely durable, taking over 50 years to decompose in landfills. This resilience makes it valuable for manufacturing but problematic as waste."
  },
  "Paper": {
    "label": "Paper",
    "instruction": "Recycle clean and dry paper together with other paper products, such as office sheets, newspapers, and magazines. Remove any plastic, staples, or other contaminants before recycling. Avoid recycling greasy or heavily soiled paper; instead, compost it if possible.",
    "fact": "Paper can be recycled up to 7 times before the fibers become too short to be reused, making it one of the most recyclable materials if kept clean."
  },
  "Cardboard": {
    "label": "Cardboard",
    "instruction": "Flatten cardboard boxes, remove tape, labels, and any plastic wrapping, and recycle only clean and dry pieces. If cardboard is greasy or wet, compost it if possible instead of sending it to landfill.",
    "fact": "Recycling one ton of cardboard saves over 9 cubic yards of landfill space and more than 46 gallons of oil, making it one of the most impactful items to recycle."
  },
  "OrganicWaste": {
    "label": "Organic Waste",
    "instruction": "Compost fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, eggshells, leaves, and grass clippings in a home or community composting system. Avoid adding meat, dairy, or oily foods unless using a specialized composting method.",
    "fact": "Organic waste makes up more than 30% of household trash, yet when composted, it becomes nutrient-rich soil instead of releasing methane gas in landfills."
  },
  "Peels": {
    "label": "Peels",
    "instruction": "Compost fruit and vegetable peels, such as banana, orange, potato, and carrot skins, to enrich soil and reduce food waste. Ensure peels are free from pesticides if using compost for edible crops.",
    "fact": "Many fruit and vegetable peels are more nutrient-rich than the flesh, yet when thrown into landfills, they produce methane as they decompose without oxygen."
  },
  "Cores": {
    "label": "Cores",
    "instruction": "Place fruit cores, such as from apples, pears, or pineapples, into compost bins with other kitchen scraps. They break down easily and improve compost quality.",
    "fact": "Fruit cores are fully compostable and provide organic matter and nutrients to soil, making them ideal for home composting."
  },
  "Plastic": {
    "label": "Plastic",
    "instruction": "Recycle clean plastics with recycling symbols #1 (PET) and #2 (HDPE) through curbside or drop-off programs. Avoid recycling plastic bags, wrappers, or styrofoam unless a specialized facility accepts them. Reduce plastic use by choosing reusable alternatives.",
    "fact": "Most plastics take hundreds of years to decompose, and many break down into microplastics that persist in the environment indefinitely."
  },
  "Metal": {
    "label": "Metal",
    "instruction": "Rinse aluminum and steel cans before placing them in the recycling bin. Take larger items, such as appliances or scrap metal, to a scrap yard or recycling center. Avoid disposing of metal in general waste, as it is highly recyclable.",
    "fact": "Metals like aluminum can be recycled infinitely without losing quality, and recycling a single aluminum can saves enough energy to run a television for three hours."
  },
  "Mold": {
    "label": "Mold",
    "instruction": "Dispose of moldy food in the trash or, if available, in a municipal composting program that can handle it safely. Avoid adding moldy food to home compost to prevent unwanted spores and odors.",
    "fact": "Some molds are harmful, but others have led to major scientific breakthroughsâ€”penicillin, a life-saving antibiotic, was discovered from mold growing on bread."
  },
  "Glass": {
    "label": "Glass",
    "instruction": "Rinse glass bottles and jars before recycling them in designated bins. Do not place broken glass, mirrors, or ceramics in standard recycling, as they require special processing. Wrap sharp glass before disposal to prevent injuries.",
    "fact": "Glass can be recycled endlessly without losing quality, and recycled glass is often turned into new bottles, jars, and construction materials."
  },
  "Wood": {
    "label": "Wood",
    "instruction": "Reuse clean, untreated wood for DIY projects, furniture repair, or crafts. If disposal is necessary, take it to a wood recycling center or have it chipped into mulch. Avoid burning treated or painted wood, as it may release toxic fumes.",
    "fact": "Wood is biodegradable and can be composted or processed into mulch, which helps reduce landfill waste and returns nutrients to the soil."
